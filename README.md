## Linux Distributions

Linux Build are generated on `Ubuntu:latest`, should run on `Ubuntu >=23.04`

known requirements:

- package `glibc >= 2.35`

  Therefore the following table (based on https://pkgs.org/search/?q=glibc, 8.7.2023) summarizes different Linux Distributions for having greater or equal version of `glibc`. For (likely) supported distributions the minimum OS Version is given that has a required glibc version. For (likely) unsupported distributions the recent highest Versions (if known) of Linux Distributions with its highest glibc version is given:

  |                    | OS                  | OS Version       | glibc     |

  :x: pretty sure not working

  :white_check_mark: should work

confirmed support:

- Ubuntu 23.04

### Troubleshooting

- may require extra packages on Linux

  ``` bash
  apt update
  apt install libdbus-1-3
  ```

- The `keyring` package auto-detects an appropriate installed keyring backend (see [PyPI - keyring](https://pypi.org/project/keyring/)). Thus may require following additional package if no backend can be detected, see #136

  ``` bash
  apt install gnome-keyring
  ```

## Development

**USDB Syncer** is written in Python.
The following explains how to set up a development environment.
A Python 3.11 installation is assumed.

### Python Setup

requires extra packages when developing **on Linux**

``` bash
apt install -y gcc python3-dev libdbus-1-dev
pkg-config --cflags --libs dbus-1
```

[tox](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox) makes it easy to run the full CI pipeline on your local machine, i.e., if the pipeline passes on your machine there is a good chance it will also pass on the build server.
The minimal setup to develop your package is to create a virtual environment and install the package and its runtime requirements:

```bash
pipenv install --dev
# activate venv
pipenv shell
```

### Run usdb_syncer

The package has a defined entry point for the GUI. Simply type in `usdb_syncer` in your terminal.

### Run tests

Run `tox` to execute the test pipeline. The tox pipelines are configured in the tox.ini file. Configurations for specific tools in the pipeline are maintained in the `pyproject.toml` file. Tox is configured to create its own virtual environments, install test dependencies and the package you are developing, and run all tests. If you changed the test requirements or want to perform a clean run for some reason, you can run `pipenv run tox -r` to recreate tox's virtual environment.

The following tools are part of the test pipeline:

- [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort): Automatically sorts your imports.

- [black](https://github.com/psf/black): Automatically and deterministically formats your code.

- [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy): Statically checks your type hints.

- [pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint): Statically checks your code for errors and code smells.

- [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest): Provides a framework for unit tests.

If you don’t want to run the whole test pipeline, you can also use single commands from the pipeline, e.g., `pytest`. The tools will automatically pick up the correct configuration from the `pyproject.toml` file.

### Building

**USDB Syncer** uses [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller) for creating
executables. In order to build **USDB Syncer**, run the following command

```bash
# On Linux
pipenv run pyinstaller --name "USDBSyncer" --onefile src/usdb_syncer/main.py

# On macOS
pipenv run pyinstaller --name "USDBSyncer" --windowed src/usdb_syncer/main.py

# On Windows
pipenv run pyinstaller --name "USDBSyncer" --onefile src/usdb_syncer/main.py
```

## Versioning

**USDB Syncer** uses [semantic versioning (semver)](https://semver.org/) as versioning scheme.
However, since **USDB Syncer** is not a library/API but a user-facing application, we use `MAJOR`, `MINOR` and `PATCH`
versions according to the following scheme:

- `MAJOR` version increments mean a breaking change for the end user, be it the need to install additional
  (3rd party) tools or changes that make it necessary to make changes to the already downloaded songs.
- `MINOR` version increments only involve adding backward compatible features.
- `PATCH` version increments bring bugfixes.

We will try to avoid `MAJOR` version increments whenever possible, but since the project is still in the
startup phase, they cannot be completely ruled out.
